# The configuration file for txoffer
# 
# This file is broken up into sections based on what part of
# the program it effects. Each parameter is explained, and
# an example configuration given. These examples are not the
# defaults. TXOFFER DOES NOT PROVIDE DEFAULT VALUES! What
# is specified in this document is what is used, so any
# misconfiguration can lead to unpredictability in the program.
