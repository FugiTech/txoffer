# The configuration file for txoffer
# 
# This file is broken up into sections based on what part of
# the program it effects. Each parameter is explained, and
# an example configuration given. These examples are not the
# defaults. TXOFFER DOES NOT PROVIDE DEFAULT VALUES! What
# is specified in this document is what is used, so any
# misconfiguration can lead to unpredictability in the program.


#### PACK DETECTION ###

# The directory to find pack files in. Replace watch with you directory
#
# watch_directory: watch
# Example : watch_directory: /var/www/docs/

watch_directory: watch

# Whether to validate CRCs before adding files to the packlist
# If enabled, searches the filename for an eight character
# CRC surrounded in brackets - [A0B1C2D3]
#
# crc_validation: true

crc_validation: false

# A glob-style pattern to match potential pack files against
# Files not matching this pattern will not be offered
# Matched against the absolute path of the file
#
# include:
#   - "*.mp3"
#   - "*.png"
#
# Note: null can be used to include everything

include: null

# A glob-style pattern for potential pack files to exclude
# Files matching this pattern will not be offered
# Matched against the absolute path of the file
# Overrides include
#
# exclude:
#   - "*.tmp"
#   - "*/.*"
#
# Note: null can be used to exclude nothing

exclude: null

### IRC BOT ###

# A list of connections to make
# Each connection must specify a host, port, nickname, and list of channels
# Each connection may specify a nickserv password
#
# irc:
#   -
#     host: irc.rizon.net
#     port: 6667
#     nickname: txoffer
#     password: txoffer
#     channels:
#       - "#txoffer"
#       - "##txoffer password"
#   -
#     host: irc.freenode.org
#     port: 6667
#     nickname: txoffer
#     channels:
#       - "#txoffer"
#       - "##txoffer password"
#
# Replace [] with command above

irc: []

### URL ###
#
# URL used in announce messages and !list. Useful if address function borks your downloading.
# For example I needed to set up address to my server ip to xdcc work properly, and I want my subdomain appear in messages,
# even though I can't use revdns because of multiple bots on one server, and more subdomains.
#
#ddlurl: "http://rose.nalapl3.pl/"
ddlurl: ""

### WEB SERVER ###

# What function the webserver fulfills
#
# "ddl" allows HTTP direct download
# "xdcc" just lists packs and copies the IRC command to the user's clipboard
# "nothing" disables the webserver completely
#
# web_function: ddl

web_function: ddl

# A nicely formatted address to give clients
# Do not include a port number
#
# address: www.example.com
#
# Note: null can be used to automatically detect IP

address: null

# Override automatic port detection with this value
# Useful if proxying behind nginx or apache
#
# port: 8080
#
# Note: null can be used to automatically detect port

port: null

# Use specified header to determine client IP
# Useful if proxying behind nginx
#
# proxy_header: x-real-ip
#
# Note: null can be used to use the raw IP

proxy_header: null

# A list of endpoints to listen on. 
# This is the port where web interface can be accessed. 
# Proxying with nginx or apache is useful if you don't want to type the port.
# Use this or port, whichever suits you.
#
# endpoints:
#   - tcp:80
#   - tcp:8080:interface=127.0.0.1
#   - unix:txoffer.sock
#
# Note: use [] instead of null to not listen on any endpoints

endpoints: []

### THROTTLING ###

# Max global connections
#
# global_concurrent: 100
#
# Note: null can be used for unlimited connections
# null is not recommended if your server doesn't have strong connection speed.

global_concurrent: null

# Max connections per IP
# HTTP and XDCC use different pools, so it is possible
# for users to use twice the connections specified here
# if they use both services simultaneously
#
# ip_concurrent: 1
#
# Note: null can be used for unlimited connections

ip_concurrent: null

# Max bandwidth per connection (in bytes per second)
#
# throttle: 500000
#
# Note: null can be used for unlimited bandwidth

throttle: null

# Connection Timeout (in seconds)
# How long to wait for the XDCC SEND or HTTP download
# to be accepted and start
# Set it to 2 if you want to enable download manager support. 
# This will make high CPU and RAM usage. Not recommended for weak server.
#
# timeout: 2

timeout: 60

# How often users waiting in the HTTP queue refresh the page in seconds
# Should be less than the timeout
# Set it to 1 if you want to enable download manager support. timeout must be 2 or higher.
#
# web_refresh: 1

web_refresh: 40

### MISCELLANEOUS ###

# The string to use for representing unlimited connections
# or unlimited bandwidth
# Can be replace with other unicode characters.
#
# infinity: "\u221E"

infinity: "\u221E"

# Maximum number of search results
# Search results include filenames, which can be quite long
# Keep this low to prevent flooding
# 
# search_limit: 5

search_limit: 3

# Whether to log what files we send to whom
# Turn off if you don't want to be responsible for such data
# (or if it is filling up your harddrive)
#
# log_requests: true

log_requests: true
